# So You Want to Work at Claris?


First, thank you for spending some time with us. We hope you enjoy this process as much as we do. 
 
Second, this isn't a take home test and there is no expectation for you to do any coding before the actual interview. All we ask is that you clone the repo and have the app running locally before the interview. 
 
Third, I can't give you the prompts or questions now...don't want to ruin all the fun....but you should expect to build a new component or two, interact with and generate some services, and work with observables and some RxJS operators.
